# pio

Manage a small JSON database with a small scripting language.

## Get started

### Open Pio Online Editor

You can find it here: [https://allnulled.github.io/pio](https://allnulled.github.io/pio)

### Test the syntax

Every command is made with the following syntax:

```
{operation}{store}[:{item}]?[/{property}:{value}]*
```

The available operations are:

- `+`: adds an item to the store.
- `-`: removes an items from the store.
- `!`: edits an items from the store.
- `?`: selects an item [or some of them] from the store.
- `:`: execute some command from the store.

To create a store, simply add a new item in it.

To run the commands, you can click the 'play' button of the editor, or hit [CONTROL] + [ENTER] in your keyboard.
